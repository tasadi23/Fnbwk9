🛤️ Reflecting on the Journey

Wow… what an incredible journey it’s been.
Over the past 8 weeks, I’ve gone from learning the basics of HTML and CSS 🎨, to building fully functional apps with JavaScript 💻, and even diving into the world of backend development with Python 🐍.

I’ve:
	•	Built real projects 🏗️
	•	Solved real-world problems 🧠
	•	Developed skills that many only dream of ✨

It’s been intense, but incredibly rewarding.

🚀 This Week’s Mission: Finish Strong

Even though I’ve come a long way, the journey’s not quite over.
This final week is about tying everything together and giving it my absolute best. I want to walk away knowing that I gave it my all.

It’s not just about completing the work — it’s about owning the progress I’ve made and preparing for what comes next. 🔜
